This is a simple security system for door status monitoring based on the Arduino R4 and Duck DNS.  This sketch tracks door open and close events so you can see door activity via a simple webserver.  Works with the Arduino R4, not the R3.  Enter your Wifi info and duck DNS registration.   This example uses 4 zones, Front Door, Back Door, Slider, and Basement.   Door switching is between Pins 8, 9, 10, 11 and Gnd.   Customize door names and pins to meet your needs.
